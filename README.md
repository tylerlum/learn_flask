# learn_flask
The purpose of this repository is to save my progress in learning Flask. This is a basic Flask app that allows you to create a list of tasks, delete tasks, and update them.

Run `python3 app.py` after installing requirements.

I followed the Flask tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA&t=120s).
